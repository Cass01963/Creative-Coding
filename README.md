# Creative-Coding
Welcome to my reppository filled with all of my projects that I created in the course FMX-310 Creative Coding. The programming languages that I used in each project consist of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Feel free to download the folder to your preferred IDE and open the HTML file through a Live Server.
